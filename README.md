OOP - Object Oriented Programming

Introduction

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around the concepts of Classes and Objects. It enables you to create organized and reusable code.

Class: High level blue-print that is used to generate a concrete object. A class has attributes and methods.

Attributes: the internal state of the class
Methods: actions (functions) that can be performed by objects of the class, and that can use and modify attributes
Object: A specific instance of a class. While classes define the attributes and methods, an object has specific attribute values and can run those methods.

Example:

Class Person - This is a concept that has some characteristics (attributes) and defines how some actions are performed (methods)
Objects: John, Sarah and Mike - actual people with specific characteristics and that can perform the actions
